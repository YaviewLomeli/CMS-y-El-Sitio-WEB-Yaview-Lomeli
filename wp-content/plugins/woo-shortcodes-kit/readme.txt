= How i can use the translation ready files? =

Now WSHK is internazionalized, have a english template and the ready Spanish translation.

By default the plugin take your site language how reference, so dont need nothing to get the plugin if your language is English or Spanish.

If you need translate to other languages, you can do it by yourself, just need make clic in the developement section and do clic in [Translate "Woo Shortcodes Kit" into your language](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/woo-shortcodes-kit) or use [Loco Translate](https://es.wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/) to write your own language with a English template.

For other hand you can write your customs text to display in the Frontend.


= Which is your recommendation ? =

I recommend put all the shortcodes to build your own myaccount page in the same page, and **must be selected how WooCommerce's myaccount page**. 

To do all more easy i have made a new addon for WSHK, in some days will be available!
